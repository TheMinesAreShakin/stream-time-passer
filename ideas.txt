chatroom like environment to start
a few characters that have a personality and occasionally chat messages?
-nile the nihlist
--everything is meaningless
-fun fact fred
--only chats fun facts
-angry andy
--gets angry at the other chatters
-quoting quintin
--only chats quotes
-impatient issac
--"are we starting yet"
-captain obvious
--"this is the start of the stream"
---"thanks captain obvious"
-granny
-dog
--woof
-timing tina
-rosie the roaster
--ready to throw hands or backhanded comments
-back in my day boomer
-spam sam
-poetry paula
a timer of some sort, obviously (different for starting vs brb?)
characters can respond to what others are saying
dialog stored in files that are easily editable/readable?
different rarities of dialog?

start with cmd output then go from there
pygame i think so that adding in images and other such gags is easier later on (emotes?)
or maybe obs script?
